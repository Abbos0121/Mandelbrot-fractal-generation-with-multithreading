How it works:
mandelbrot(c): Calculates the number of iterations for a point in the complex plane.
compute_row(y): Calculates the values ​​for each point in a row of the image.
generate_fractal(): Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to compute the rows of the image in parallel.
Pillow (PIL): Used to convert the result into an image and save it.
Features:
Multithreading speeds up the computation by splitting the task into rows of the image.
NumPy helps to work with arrays of data to store information about each pixel.
Pillow is used to visualize the fractal.
This code creates a PNG image of the Mandelbrot fractal and saves it as mandelbrot_fractal.png.
